# Emeka Maddy's-Portfolio

My name is Emeka Maddy. I’m a product manager with deep expertise in product development and a growing passion for automation and innovation [Case study](https://icon.widen.net/s/jsvlxcskqk). I’ve worked hands-on with technologies like RPA, SSO, API integrations, SCIM, and the validation of regulated systems.
My journey into AI began in 2024 through on-the-job exposure, and my literacy has grown through dedicated project work as part of the IBM AI Professional Certification Program [see projects here](https://github.com/Madz04uk/IBM-AI-Product-Manager-Certification-). 
Currently, I’m applying AI to my e-commerce venture, [Mother4nature cosmetics](https://mother4nature.com/), where I’m focused on enhancing user engagement and driving meaningful conversions.

## Stage 1:

Use Case: On‑Demand Conversational Assistant for Ecommerce

**Problem**:

User engagement on the ecommerce site was slow and highly manual. Customers had to navigate multiple pages to find product information, leading to friction and delayed decision‑making. The business needed an on‑demand, guided experience to improve customer satisfaction and reduce drop‑off.

**Approach**:

Designed and implemented a lightweight chatbot with preconfigured prompts that guide users through key workflows such as product discovery, FAQs, and purchase support. The solution was built to be simple, scalable, and aligned with the brand’s tone.
Design & Architecture

• 	__User Story__: As a customer, I want quick answers and guided support so I can make confident purchase decisions without navigating the entire site.

• 	__Conversation Hierarchy__: Structured flows for discovery, product info, and checkout support.

• 	__Intents & Workflows__: Mapped core intents (e.g., “find product”, “learn ingredients”, “skin assessments”) to deterministic workflows.

• 	[Code Pattern: Modular prompt‑driven architecture with reusable components for intents, responses, and UI integration.](https://github.com/Madz04uk/Emeka-Portfolio/blob/main/Chatbot%20code%20pattern.png)

**Result**:

The chatbot is now live on the ecommerce website [Mother4nature cosmetics](https://mother4nature.com/). It successfully handled its first customer order end‑to‑end, demonstrating improved engagement and reduced friction in the buying journey.
