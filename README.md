# Emeka Maddy's-Portfolio

About Me
My name is Emeka Maddy. I’m a product manager with deep expertise in product leadership and stakeholder engagement across automation and innovation. I’ve worked hands-on with technologies like RPA, SSO, API integrations, SCIM, and the validation of regulated systems.
My journey into AI began in 2024 through on-the-job exposure, and my literacy has grown through dedicated project work as part of the IBM AI Professional Certification Program. You can explore those projects  [see projects here](https://github.com/Madz04uk/IBM-AI-Product-Manager-Certification-). 
Currently, I’m applying AI to my e-commerce venture, [Mother4nature cosmetics](https://mother4nature.com/), where I’m focused on enhancing user engagement and driving meaningful conversions.
